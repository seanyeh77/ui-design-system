LayerGraph: on touch screens the shared-item boxes no longer cover the whole page. Their enlarged touch area (::after) measured against the window because the box was `position: static`; it is `relative` now. Tooltip: closes when its trigger loses focus, only one is open at a time, and a closing Tooltip leaves at once instead of waiting for its entrance animation, so tabbing through cut-off DataTable cells no longer leaves Tooltips stacked. ui check: reports touch areas larger than their own control (they cover other controls) and no longer counts them as big enough targets.
